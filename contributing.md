# Contributing

All that is required, code wise, is that you follow all the
[WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).

## /develop or /master

The `master` branch holds the most up to date released code. Please base your
Pull Requests off of the `develop` branch. Security or hotfixes should
be branched off `master`.

## Pull Requests

If you feel like your Pull Request is ready to be merged in, please add the
`ready-for-merge` label.

**All Pull Requests should be compared to `develop`.**

### Resolves #

Please include **" - Resolves #XX"** with the number of the issue it resolves
in the title of your Pull Request. For Multiple use "Resolves #XX #XX".

# Pro Issues

If you code a pro issue, it will automatically be included in the `.Org` version
of the Plugin for your hard work.

# Code Reviews

If there are any Pull Requests in place that are marked with the `ready-for-merge`
label, please go in and check the code they have written and :+1: it if you
like what they've done.
